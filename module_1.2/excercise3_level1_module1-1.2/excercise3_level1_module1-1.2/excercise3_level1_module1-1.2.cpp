/*
* Excercise 3 answers:
* (a) defined in C.h
* 
* (b) tested the move constructor and the move assignment operator in the main().
* to ensure that the move constructor is called instead of the copy constructor, we need to use std::move(); 
* eg. C Cobj2(move(Cobj1));
* this ensures that regardless of Cobj1 being a rvalue or an lvalue, the compiler treats it like an rvalue and
* and calls the move constructor
* 
* let us take another example, C Cobjy(Cobjx);
* if the Cobjx is an rvalue, then the move constructor will be called by default
* however, if Cobjx is an lvalue, then the copy consturctor will be called; unless we force using the std::move as we have above
* 
* 
* (c) if we use an lvalue as the source of an move operation, then the compiler will not use the move constructor or 
* the move assignment operator, even if they are defined. The copy constructor and the copy assignment operator will
* instead be called.
* As mentioned earlier, we can force the use of the move counterparts by telling the copiler to treat the 
* lvalue as a rvalue using std::move()
